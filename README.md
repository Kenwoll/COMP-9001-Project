# Introduction

CYBERSHOP TERMINAL is console based, cyberpunk themed and futuristic online store. Users can register and obtain their 
ssh keys to signin. For version v.1.001 users can request delivery by drone and provide biometric payment on delivery.
While testing the application use os terminal instead of IDE internal terminal (like PyCharm) as they don't fully 
support rich terminal rendering.

## How to sign in

You can create your own user and application will store user specific ssh key in the data folder. However, if you don't want to create user then application comes with already created one.
You can use `neon_hacker` username to sign in and explore the rarest inventory in the galaxy.
